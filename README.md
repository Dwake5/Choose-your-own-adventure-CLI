# Group-game

This project was made by Patrick Hofmann, Dunia Al-Baghdadi and Danny Wakeling. 
This was our final week project for Module 1 at Flatiron School. 

It is a choose your own adventure game, meaning the story changes based on your decisions, themed around your time on campus over 5 days. It saves the use's end of game stats in a database SQL. 
The ultimate goal is to make it to the end and secure a job. 

It impletents the use of player attributes, those being knowledge, stress and energy. If your energy drops low enough you reach an end of game screen. 
Knowledge was meant to be a gatekeeper to code challenges or bosses. To which we have the logic implemented for but not enough time to implement, probably would have needed a few more hours. Stress currently having no function, but in testing kept people interested and gave them something to keep track and be conscious of.
